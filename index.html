<h2>Why I Love Photography</h2>
<p> I really enjoy everything about photography. Photography to me is theraputic because it relieves any stress I have. I currently take yearbook here at school with 15 other students. This is my second year on staff and I'm very excited for what's to come. Last year was a huge experience for me because I never really knew all the responsibilities that come with photography and photo editing.  </p>

<h3>Where I see myself involved with photography</h3>

<p>I am a senior in highschool this year. What that means is that time is dwindling down to where i need to start thinking about college and what i want to do in life. I really struggled with that topic because I never really knew. I tried different things and I'm currently still trying new things. I just recently decided I don't want to pursue nursing anymore. I came to conclusion that it's just something I felt was neccesary for me to do. Now I've decided to just go full in to photography and eventually do big things through that career.</p>

<p> Below are some of my own personal pieces of photography. I do not own my own personal camera but I soon will be investing in one. Until that time I use the yearbook cameras to mostly take pictures for the clsss but if possible, I use it for my own personal use. For example this project. I really enjoy taking pictures of stand stills for exapmle nature and also events like football games and band competitions.</p>

<p> This photo here is from when I went to Beaufort, SC for a college tour. I was sitting with a friend eating ice cream and decided I'd play around with the camera. This was taken outside of a cafe near the port area in Beaufort. It was pretty cool because I got to see a yacht later that evening.</p>

<p> This photo here is from a playground. This was just a random afternoon with a friend and I wanted to try out new angles and things. My intention was to later edit this photo to make it look somewhat creepy. The perk to this photo was I got to play Hopscotch! </p>

<p> This photo is of my older brother Quentine. He's the person that pushes me to do great in life and follow what I believe in.

<h4>My Current Inspiration</h4>

<p> This is a sample picture of her personal photography. I really enjoy all the depth and phot editing that she has put in this picture. This picture shows different angles and lighting styles and who could look past the fact of how cute this baby looks.</p>
