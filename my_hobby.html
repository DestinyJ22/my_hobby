<h2>Why I Love Photography</h2>
<p> I really enjoy everything about photography. Photography to me is theraputic because it relieves any stress I have. I currently take yearbook here at school with 15 other students. This is my second year on staff and I'm very excited for what's to come. Last year was a huge experience for me because I never really knew all the responsibilities that come with photography and photo editing.  </p>

<h3>Where I see myself involved with photography</h3>

<p>I am a senior in highschool this year. What that means is that time is dwindling down to where i need to start thinking about college and what i want to do in life. I really struggled with that topic because I never really knew. I tried different things and I'm currently still trying new things. I just recently decided I don't want to pursue nursing anymore. I came to conclusion that it's just something I felt was neccesary for me to do. Now I've decided to just go full in to photography and eventually do big things through that career.</p>
<p> Below are some of my own personal pieces of photography. I do not own my own personal camera but I soon will be investing in one. Until that time I use the yearbook cameras to mostly take pictures for the clsss but if possible, I use it for my own personal use. For example this project.</p>

<p>This is my current inspiration for many different things. She is mainly my inspiration for photgraphy. Her pictures are phenomenal in my eyes and I love them. <a href="http://www.girrlscoutphoto.com">explore here</a.></p>
